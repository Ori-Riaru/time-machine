# Time Machine v1.3

Time Machine V1.3 is a utility for changing your desktop background and exploring historical events. It is based on an [image create by u/Wurstpunkt](https://www.reddit.com/r/thomastheplankengine/comments/12hnk37/in_a_dream_i_had_a_software_that_allowed_me_to/) on reddit.

## Demo

![Demo](./.github/demo.gif)

## Install

[releases page](https://github.com/RiaruAzaki/time-machine/releases).

## Controls

`Tip: Disable Deterministic and maximize sqwimble to get a random event.`

#### Time

The target time from which an event is chosen.

#### Location

The target coordinates of the location from which an event is chosen.

#### Sqwimble

The allowed range in years from which an event is considered valid.

#### Deterministic

Determines whether Time Machine will always choose the closest event to the target or a random valid event.

#### Assume Form

Determines if Time Machine will change the desktop background to the image of the event.

## Future Plans

Currently adding event times, locations, and descriptions is very time-consuming. A script to automatically scrape event info from wikipedia would be useful.
